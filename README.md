# Headless e-commerce with Angular, Sanity, & Snipcart

![angular-sanity-snipcart-ecommerce](https://snipcart.com/media/175900/angular-sanity-snipcart-headless-ecommerce.jpg)

Here I show how to enable Angular e-commerce on top of Sanity, a promising headless CMS. Some store features, like the shopping cart & back office, will be offloaded to Snipcart, our dev-first e-commerce solution.

The tutorial covers how to:

- Set up Sanity with a products schema (data modeling)
- Input real products data in the headless CMS
- Build an Angular app with appropriate components to display storefront
